# Ebay pc parts sale analysis

Situation:
- My previous pc no longer fulfills my needs of gaming, I bought new components and wanted to sell my old components. 
- I was doing a good job selling my previous graphics cards GTX 1080 and CPU: i7-7700K
- Recently I am trying to sell my motherboard, power supply, RAMs and water cooling system, however, I noticed that I had relisted those products several times, no luck
- So what has changed my sales? What is the root cause of the issue? How would I proceed and sell it at a statisfying price?

Initial Guess:
- GPUs and CPUs are of higher demands?
- Do I have less competitors on the market?
- What about the product itself? (brand reputation? price vs value?)
- My description of the item? Photo of the item?
- Bid / Buyout options avaliable?
- Pricing / Expectation
