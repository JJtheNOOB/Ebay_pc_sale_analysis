# Ebay pc parts sale analysis

__The problem & the situation:__
- My previous pc no longer fulfills my needs of gaming, I bought new components and wanted to sell my old components. 
- I was doing a good job selling my previous graphics cards GTX 1080 and CPU: i7-7700K
- Recently I am trying to sell my motherboard, power supply, RAMs and water cooling system, however, I noticed that I had relisted those products several times, no luck
- So what has changed my sales? What is the root cause of the issue? How would I proceed and sell it at a statisfying price?

__Initial Guess:__
- The Market:
  - GPUs and CPUs are of higher demands compared to other components? -- Number of products for sale at the moment
  - Do I have less competitors on the market?  -- The secific product's for sale number

- The Item:
  - Bid / Buyout options avaliable?  -- Yes / No (price difference large, starting low, buyout high)
  - Brand reputation -- Average rating of the brand in pc components / specific items
  - Price - performance ratio  -- Looking for overpriced / value for money / worth it etc
  - Description detailed enough? (Photo etc)

- The expectation:
  - Pricing Expectation  -- Item conditions, item price drop with respect to days of purchase

__Some metrics: (source from Ebay):__
- Listing impression: Every time my listing appears on Ebay it + 1
- Page Reviews: # of visitors
